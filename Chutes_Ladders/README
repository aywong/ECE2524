Chutes and Ladders Instructions
===============================

Setup:

1. Connect the Rotary Encoder Module to the bottom row of the JA Port
2. Connect the OLED to the JD port
3. Connect your mini USB connector to the "DEBUG" slot, and other side of the USB to the computer
3. Open MPLAB X
	a. Go to file > Open Project
	b. point to the "Code" folder you downloaded
4. Debug the program in MPLAB X. 

After it is finished, the program should be running on the microcontroler. 

===============================

Game Information:

The game board is 48 spaces (6x8 board).

Players will be prompted at the begining of their turn on the OLED.

If you forget who's turn you're on, the corresponding LEDs on the board light up. 
	(ex. LED1 for player 1)

You can't land on a chute on the first row (spaces 1-6) and a ladder on the last row (spaces 43-48)

===============================

Pre-Game:

1. The game board will prompt you to select the number of players (1-4 can play)
	a. To do this use the rotary encoder to choose and button one on the board to confirm choice.

2. After the number of players are chosen, the board will prompt for difficulty level
	a. One selects easy mode and two selects hard mode.

After the difficulty level is selected the game will begin!

===============================

How to Play:

Use button number one to roll the die when your player number is prompted. 

The game board will show you how many you rolled and what your current position on the board is.
After you move your die roll, it is possible to encounter a chute or ladder.
	A chute will knock you back one die roll (1-6), and a ladder will move you forward a die roll (1-6).
	
		Easy Mode: You have a 10% chance of landing on a chute or ladder

		Hard Mode: You have a 15% chance of landing on a chute or ladder


Once you have finished your turn press button number 1 to end your turn and move on to the next player.

Repeat this process for the number of players in the game.

===============================

Winning:

The game will continue until a player has reached space number 48.  


	Easy Mode:

	In Easy mode, advancing past space 48 will also result in the player winning.


	Hard Mode:  
	
	In Hard mode, you must land on space 48 by an exact die roll. If you roll greater than the spaces
	required, you will move backward the number of spaces left on the die roll.
	EX: If you are on space 45 and roll a 6 you will end up on space 45 again. If you were to roll a 5,
	you would end up on space 46.


After you have won, it will go back to the menu in "Pre-Game"

===============================

Enjoy the game!
