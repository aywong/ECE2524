THREE SMALL ASSIGNMENTS:
This full assignment will consist of three small assignments for a total of 40 points.
	“Paper” Grade Book (10)
	Alphabetizer (10)
	Student Grade Organizer (20)

=======================================================================

“Paper” Grade Book (10):
In python, create a “paper” grade book in which a user can enter a student’s name the grade they received on an assignment. The user should be able to add, delete, and view the list they created. The grade book should consist of the student’s first and last name, ID, and grade on the assignment.

Alphabetizer (10):
In python create a program that reads in a list of words from a text file. The program should be able to alphabetize this list and then output them into another text file named alphabetized.

Student Grade Organizer (20):
In python, create a student grade organizer that is able to read in text files of a student’s first and last name, ID, and current grade in the class (integer percentage) and add them to the ‘grade book’.  It should also allow the user to add and delete users through the command line interface. The user should be able to view the list then created on the console but also export the list into another text document.

Aside from just being able to add in students one by one, add in students by groups through text files, delete students, view the list, and export the list, it should also be able to alphabetize the students for viewing, or put them in order from lowest to highest grade.
