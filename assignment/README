Justification:
========================================================================
1.
My assignment is relevant to the course because it uses python. Also this assignment allows the user to see the separation of parts in a program. Which could help them code with modularity 

Another reason why I wanted to set up an assignment like this is because I think one of the hardest parts of this class was really just starting an assignment. Each assignment to me just felt sort of like a mountain. When I looked at it, I didn’t even know where to begin, like with the python assignments; If I had made a smaller python assignment (even if it wasn’t as relevant to the bigger ones) it would have made creating the bigger assignments easier to start and do. I think having the experience with small assignments even if they seem too easy, would be very helpful to conquer something bigger.

========================================================================
2.
For the first two assignments, since they are easier and shouldn’t require much coding, they can just be the full 10 or 0 points of whether it works. For the third assignment, I would give 10 points to content, 5 to functionality, and another 5 to syntax and style.
